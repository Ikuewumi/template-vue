# Vue + Vite Template App

A simple, opinionated template for me to quickly get started with a vue-3 app.

**@todos**:

 1. Change the details of ```package.json``` to suit your current project
 2. change the sass files relating to color and fonts to suit your project. They can be found in the ```src/scss``` directory

**Run**:

```js
pnpm install
```

to get started
